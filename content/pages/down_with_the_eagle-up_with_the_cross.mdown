# Down with the Eagle---Up with the Cross

There are two ways of governing people:

1. The Cross---The method of liberty
2. The Eagle---The method of statism

I will only cover The Cross today.

# 1. The Cross

The Cross represents rule through social stigma, religion, and self governance!
For example the Baptist churches are organized through independant cells governed by the Holy Bible!
One cell does not have power to force the other cells to do as it says!
